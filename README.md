# Cost-Of-Pizza-Party-

#Project Description
a cost of pizza Party program which is created using functions or methods like they are called in java. In addition to writing method im returning variables and assign them to other function as value being passed. pass by value works the same as pass by reference in c++ only this time it has a new name because its now in java. the program calculates home many slices the party needs, how may boxs of pizza there are going to be, and cost of all the boxes of pizzas. I will add more later on to elaborate with this project. thx.
